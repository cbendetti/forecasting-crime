## Instructions

To complete this report, open the template Rmd file and write your report. Make sure to hide all code but include that necessary code in the Rmd to create the visualizations and the tables that you need. When done, knit the file to pdf or html format. Provide any comments/questions about this report in the section below 

**Learning Goals:** This is an opportunity synthesize all that you've learned about correlated and demonstrate your understanding by writing a concise, but thorough report on your analysis. You should go beyond what you did in the initial report, considering other research questions, refine the original work, and take feedback into account. 

**Comments/Questions to Prof. H:** 



*Next section to be completed by Prof. H and preceptors. Do not type below this line.*

## Feedback 

Heggeseth Feedback:

- Improved intro/abstract
- Improved Methods -- could be improved a bit more in terms of flow (think carefully when prepping your capstone presentation about what information is necessary for a broader audience -- you want to break it down to justify why a GEE model is necessary rather than just linear regression)
- With results, "Violent crimes at night have the highest p-value at 0.44 which is still less than 0.5" isn't quite accurately describing what the model output tells you. All of the slope coefficients are differences between categories and the p-value is the probability of getting an estimated difference this large or larger, if there were really no difference.  
- Proportion of crimes that are violent v. non-violent are interesting plots
- I noted ways the graphs could have been improved in the presentation feedback; particularly the residuals (have 0 be white rather than purple). 
- A table of coefficients of the model would have been a nice addition to the results section before showing the predictions
- "Our dataset went from 106,863 to 3,171 observations." This is a deceptive sentence because the first is individual crimes and the second number are summaries..
- I wish the conclusions tied a bit more back to the Intro with PredPol directly. While this does not replicate PredPol, it does try to get at the same thing as PredPol at a larger scale. If police were more interested in preventing violent crime, how would you use the predictions differently or model differently?  

Grade: 90/100

Overall Feedback: Very good report. You should be proud of your work.
